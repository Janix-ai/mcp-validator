# MCP Validator Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

Based on the recommendations in `report.md`, the following cleanup actions have been completed:

1. **Created Archive Structure**
   - Created an `archive` directory to store deprecated files rather than deleting them
   - Organized with subdirectories: `scripts`, `planning`, and `temp`
   - Added README to document the purpose of the archive

2. **Moved Deprecated Files to Archive**
   - **Scripts**:
     - `apply_fastmcp_improvements.sh` -> `archive/scripts/`
     - `mcp_testing/scripts/custom_http_tester.py` -> `archive/scripts/`
     - `mcp_testing/scripts/custom_http_test.py` -> `archive/scripts/`
     - `mcp_testing/scripts/fastmcp_test.py` -> `archive/scripts/`
     - `mcp_testing/fastmcp_test.py` -> `archive/testing/`
   
   - **Planning Documents**:
     - `plan.md` -> `archive/planning/`
     - `opensource_plan.md` -> `archive/planning/`
   
   - **Temporary Files**:
     - `.DS_Store` -> `archive/temp/`
     - `.coverage` -> `archive/temp/`

3. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `.pytest_cache/` to ensure it's excluded from version control
   - Removed `archive/` to ensure archived files are committed to version control for now

4. **Verified Functionality**
   - Tested the FastMCP HTTP server with SSE transport
   - Tested the STDIO server for the 2025-03-26 protocol version
   - All tests passed, confirming that our cleanup didn't break any functionality

## Next Steps

The following additional recommendations from the report could be addressed in future cleanup phases:

1. **Consolidate Similar Test Scripts**
   - Review and potentially merge test scripts with similar functionality
   - Create a clearer hierarchy of test types

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   - Apply consistent naming across the codebase
   - Document naming conventions for contributors

3. **Centralize Documentation**
   - Update all README files to reflect current state
   - Create a more centralized documentation structure

4. **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement more consistent error handling patterns
   - Enhance logging with structured formats

## Note on Archived Files

The archived files are kept in version control for now, allowing us to reference them if needed. Once we're confident they're no longer required, we can:
1. Remove them from the repository
2. Add the `archive/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent future files from being committed
