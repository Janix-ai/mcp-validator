# MCP HTTP Server Implementation Status - May 5, 2025

## Current State

The HTTP server implementation has made significant progress but needs alignment with STDIO server testing methodology for consistent validation.

### Working Features
1. Basic HTTP/JSON-RPC Protocol
   - Proper HTTP/1.1 protocol handling
   - Correct headers and status lines
   - Keep-alive connections maintained
   - Session management working

2. Core MCP Methods
   - `initialize` - Working properly with protocol version negotiation
   - `shutdown` - Clean server shutdown
   - `tools/list` - Returns available tools
   - `tools/call` - Synchronous tool execution
   - `tools/call-async` - Asynchronous tool execution with proper status tracking

3. SSE Implementation
   - Connection establishment successful
   - Event streaming working
   - Notification delivery functional

### Testing Alignment Plan

The current testing approach needs to be unified between STDIO and HTTP servers. Here are the next steps:

1. Test Runner Consolidation
   - Use `compliance_report.py` as the base for both STDIO and HTTP testing
   - Adapt the HTTP transport layer to work with the compliance report framework
   - Ensure consistent test case execution between both transport types

2. Required Changes
   - Create an HTTP transport adapter for the compliance report framework
   - Modify test runner to handle both STDIO and HTTP transports
   - Update test case execution to be transport-agnostic
   - Ensure consistent reporting format between both server types

3. Implementation Steps
   a. Transport Layer:
      - Create `HttpTransportAdapter` class implementing the same interface as STDIO
      - Add HTTP-specific connection handling and session management
      - Implement proper cleanup and resource management

   b. Test Runner:
      - Update `run_tests` function to accept transport type
      - Add HTTP-specific configuration options
      - Ensure consistent timeout handling between transports

   c. Reporting:
      - Use same report format for both STDIO and HTTP
      - Include transport-specific details in reports
      - Generate consistent compliance status indicators

4. Validation Process
   - Run same test suite against both server types
   - Compare reports to ensure consistency
   - Verify that all 37 core tests run on both transports
   - Ensure identical pass/fail criteria

### Next Actions
1. Create `HttpTransportAdapter` class
2. Modify `compliance_report.py` to handle HTTP transport
3. Update test runner configuration
4. Test with both server types and verify consistency

### Known Issues
1. HTTP server currently tested with different methodology than STDIO
2. Reports not consistent between server types
3. Some test cases may need adaptation for HTTP transport

### Test Results
- STDIO Server: 37 tests passing
- HTTP Server: Testing methodology needs alignment

### Notes
- The goal is to have identical test coverage and reporting between both server types
- This will ensure consistent compliance validation regardless of transport
- The unified approach will make it easier to maintain and extend the test suite

## Current Issues

1. Testing Methodology Inconsistency
   - HTTP server using different testing approach than STDIO
   - Need to align with compliance_report.py methodology
   - Missing comprehensive test coverage compared to STDIO (37 tests)

2. Notification System Issues
   - Function reference error in notification handling
   - Multiple rapid `notifications/poll` requests
   - Need rate limiting implementation

### Required Changes

1. Testing Framework Alignment
   - Modify compliance_report.py to support both STDIO and HTTP
   - Add transport type parameter (--transport-type stdio|http)
   - Ensure consistent test cases across both transports

2. Test Coverage Gaps
   - Protocol version negotiation
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Session management
   - Notification delivery
   - Resource management
   - Tool execution (sync/async)

## Next Steps

1. Testing Framework Updates
   - Create HTTP transport adapter in compliance_report.py
   - Add HTTP-specific configuration options
   - Implement request/response mapping for HTTP transport
   - Add session management handling

2. Test Suite Alignment
   - Port all 37 STDIO tests to HTTP format
   - Add HTTP-specific test cases if needed
   - Ensure identical validation criteria

3. Implementation Fixes
   - Fix notification system bugs
   - Add proper rate limiting
   - Improve error handling
   - Add missing protocol features

4. Documentation
   - Update testing documentation
   - Add HTTP-specific test instructions
   - Document transport differences

## Test Commands

### Current HTTP Testing
```bash
python -m mcp_testing.scripts.http_test --server-url http://localhost:8000/mcp --protocol-version 2025-03-26
```

### Proposed New Testing
```bash
# STDIO Testing (Current)
python -m mcp_testing.scripts.compliance_report --server-command "./minimal_mcp_server/minimal_mcp_server.py" --protocol-version 2025-03-26

# HTTP Testing (To Be Implemented)
python -m mcp_testing.scripts.compliance_report --transport-type http --server-url http://localhost:8000/mcp --protocol-version 2025-03-26
```
